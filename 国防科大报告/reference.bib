  abstract = {在学术规范和科研不端之间，有一个复杂、有时甚至是困难的主观判断空间------灰色地带。灰色地带科研不端行为不易发现、不易认定也不易处理，是科研失信的``重灾区''之一，能够对科研诚信建设造成极大的阻碍。本研究探讨灰色地带不端行为的署名问题，利用撤销论文作为研究对象，通过设计``署名问题具体撤销原因分类''，深入分析因署名问题撤销论文的具体原因，发现授权同意、贡献分配与声明模糊是最常见的问题。基于对署名问题中存在的灰色地带的探索，本文进一步提出了防范与治理建议。},

  abstract = {Whose role is it to teach academic integrity to university students? We explored academics' conceptions about their role in promoting academic integrity in two countries, namely New Zealand and Finland. We used Q methodology to find common configurations of perspectives that can help us understand the premises based on which academics approach the tasks and roles associated with teaching academic integrity. The 56 academics in our sample were asked to sort 42 statements highlighting a broad spectrum of perspectives on academic integrity and the teaching of it, and answer some related interview questions. A centroid factor analysis using PQMethod software resulted in five configurations of views with distinctive characteristics. We used three frameworks to interrogate these differences: (1) possible narrative from a students' perspective, (2) Biggs's levels of thinking about teaching, and (3) an ethical interpretation. Academics at our institutions appear united in respecting the importance of academic integrity, but not of one mind about what it is, how it should be taught, whether or not it can be taught, whose responsibility it is to teach it, and how to handle cases of misconduct. The results suggest that teachers are confused about integrity policies extant in higher education and about their roles within these. 【摘要翻译】向大学生传授学术诚信是谁的职责？我们探讨了新西兰和芬兰这两个国家的学者对他们在促进学术诚信中的作用的看法。我们使用Q方法来寻找共同的观点配置，这些观点可以帮助我们理解学者处理与教学学术诚信相关的任务和角色的前提。我们样本中的56名学者被要求对42份陈述进行排序，这些陈述强调了对学术诚信及其教学的广泛观点，并回答了一些相关的访谈问题。使用PQMethod软件进行质心因子分析，得到了具有独特特征的五种视图配置。我们使用了三个框架来质疑这些差异：(1)从学生的角度可能的叙述，(2)比格斯对教学的思考水平，以及(3)伦理解释。我们机构的学者似乎一致尊重学术诚信的重要性，但对于学术诚信是什么、应该如何教授、是否可以教授、谁有责任教授以及如何处理不当行为案件，意见不一。结果表明，教师对高等教育中现存的诚信政策以及他们在其中的角色感到困惑。},

  abstract = {This article provides a literature review on academic integrity, which encompasses the values, behaviour and conduct of academics in all aspects of their practice. This is a growing area of academic research as a result of the expansion of higher education on a global basis and concerns about standards of professional conduct. The article maps the main strands of research on academic integrity by reference to teaching, research and service using 115 articles derived from both western and Chinese literature. The review indicates that much of the literature is framed in terms of misconduct or academic corruption with research ethics the dominant focus. Researchers investigating academic integrity draw predominantly on multivariate analysis using surveys/questionnaires, documentary analysis and, more occasionally, interviews. While there has been rapid growth in the literature, a stronger focus is needed on identifying `ethical' as well as `unethical' practice despite the methodological challenges in overcoming social desirability reporting. 【摘要翻译】本文提供了关于学术诚信的文献综述，包括学者在实践的各个方面的价值观、行为和操守。由于高等教育在全球范围内的扩张和对职业行为标准的关注，这是一个不断增长的学术研究领域。本文利用115篇中西文献，从教学、研究和服务三个方面勾勒出学术诚信研究的主线。综述表明，许多文献都是以不端行为或学术腐败为框架的，研究伦理是主要焦点。调查学术诚信的研究人员主要使用调查/问卷、文献分析以及更偶尔的访谈进行多元分析。虽然文献增长迅速，但尽管在克服社会期望报告方面存在方法上的挑战，但仍需要更加关注识别``道德''和``不道德''的实践。},

  abstract = {University plagiarism policies aimed at assuring academic integrity provide for increased vigilance and disciplinary procedures to deal with transgressions. Many policies also include guidelines to teaching staff to ensure that students are adequately informed about the meaning of plagiarism and its consequences, and about methods of citing within the particular referencing system in use. However, the experience of academic advising has indicated that receiving such information is insufficient for students who, for a variety of reasons, inadvertently lapse into plagiarism. This is particularly the case for international students for whom English is a second or additional language. A simple and not excessively timeconsuming strategy is proposed for academics to ensure that students have the opportunity to learn not only the mechanics of what they are required to do, but also the reasons for the requirements and assistance in learning the language for fulfilling these requirements. The strategy involves, firstly, the induction of students into the concept of evidence-based learning as the essential characteristic of university learning, teaching and research, and secondly, the application of a tool such as genre analysis for mastering the language of their discipline. This is an awareness and development issue that is particularly important for international students whose time within the English-speaking Australian university environment may be limited to three or four years. The proposed strategy has the potential of becoming a powerful mechanism for reducing the incidence of inadvertent plagiarism, as well as raising the overall standard of written work for an increasing range of students. 【摘要翻译】旨在确保学术诚信的大学剽窃政策规定提高警惕和纪律程序来处理违规行为。许多政策还包括对教学人员的指导方针，以确保学生充分了解剽窃的含义及其后果，以及在使用的特定参考系统中引用的方法。然而，学术咨询的经验表明，对于由于各种原因无意中陷入剽窃的学生来说，收到这样的信息是不够的。对于英语是第二或附加语言的国际学生来说尤其如此。为学者们提出了一个简单且不过分耗时的策略，以确保学生不仅有机会学习他们被要求做的事情的机制，而且有机会学习要求的原因和满足这些要求的语言帮助。该策略包括，首先，引导学生接受循证学习的概念，将其作为大学学习、教学和研究的基本特征，其次，应用体裁分析等工具来掌握其学科的语言。这是一个意识和发展问题，对于国际学生来说尤其重要，他们在澳大利亚英语大学环境中的时间可能仅限于三四年。所提出的策略有可能成为一个强大的机制，减少无意剽窃的发生率，并提高越来越多的学生书面作业的整体标准。},
